If you don't have the dependencies :
In the terminal, use the command `npm init -y` to initialize and create a `package.json file` .

Then you will have to install 
-some node_modules and `package-lock.json` dependencies by running `npm install `.


You will need to install `npm i mysql2` 

Also you will need to install `npm i dotenv`


`npm i sequelize`

`npm i express`

`npm i express session`

`npm i bcrypt`

`npm i express-handlebars`

`npm i connect-session-sequelize`



Create a `.env file` in the root directory of the app.
Create three variables in the `.env file`:

-`DB_NAME`=ecommerce_db
-`DB_USER`=[your MySQL username]
-`DB_PW`=[your MySQL password]
-`DB_SESSION_SECRET`= [your secret word or sentence]

 


Then, you will need to run :

`mysql -u root -p`

then
`SOURCE db/schema.sql` to create the database and initialize the database.


TIPS: Open a second time, the repository in the integrated terminal and run : ``node seeds/index.js` to seed the databse.(you don't have to close the frist one in the case you want to interact with mysql, otherwise you can close mysql and then run  the two node actions)



Finally, you will want to run `node server.js` to start the app.



## Usage

After the installation process:

Open the terminal  and run the command `npm start` or `node server.js`

In you browser you will want to run `localhost:3001/`,
